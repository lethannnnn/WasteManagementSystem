# MyCycle+ Reward-Based Recycling Management System

## 1. Introduction

MyCycle+ is a comprehensive, reward-based recycling management system designed to revolutionize waste management by incentivizing sustainable practices. Our mission is to foster a circular economy by connecting donors, collectors, and sponsors through a seamless, technology-driven platform. The system encourages recycling by rewarding users with points that can be redeemed for valuable rewards, creating a win-win for individuals, communities, and the environment.

## 2. System Modules and Features

The MyCycle+ ecosystem is composed of four dedicated applications, each tailored to a specific user role.

### 2.1. Donor Mobile App (React Native)
- **Pickup Scheduling:** Donors can schedule on-demand pickups for their recyclable materials and receive a unique QR code for verification.
- **Reward Management:** Track reward points earned from recycling activities.
- **Redemption Catalog:** Browse and redeem rewards, such as e-wallet credits and vouchers from sponsors.
- **History & Analytics:** View personal recycling history and environmental impact metrics.
- **Gamification:** Engage with leaderboards and earn achievement badges to stay motivated.

### 2.2. Collector Mobile App (React Native)
- **Pickup Management:** View and accept incoming pickup requests from donors.
- **AI-Optimized Routing:** Utilize a Hybrid DRL-GA algorithm for the most efficient, time-saving, and fuel-efficient collection routes.
- **Status Updates:** Update pickup status in real-time (e.g., en route, completed, canceled).
- **Donor Communication:** In-app communication channel to coordinate with donors.

### 2.3. Admin Web Portal (React)
- **User & Account Management:** Oversee all user accounts (donors, collectors, sponsors).
- **Reward & Redemption Oversight:** Manage the rewards catalog and approve redemption requests.
- **System Analytics:** Access comprehensive dashboards and generate reports on system usage, recycling rates, and overall performance.
- **Content Management:** Manage app content, notifications, and user communications.

### 2.4. Sponsor Web Portal (React)
- **Business Registration:** Sponsors can register their business and undergo OCR-based identity verification.
- **Reward Submission:** Submit and manage rewards to be included in the redemption catalog.
- **Contribution Analytics:** View dashboards and analytics on their contributions and the impact of their sponsored rewards.

## 3. System Architecture and Technology Stack

MyCycle+ is built on a modern, scalable architecture to ensure reliability and performance.

- **Application Architecture:** The system is designed as a set of interconnected applications, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling of each component.
- **Development Methodology:** We follow an Agile (Sprint-based) methodology to facilitate iterative development and rapid delivery of features.

### 3.1. Technical Components
- **Frontend (Mobile):** React Native for cross-platform (iOS & Android) development.
- **Frontend (Web):** React.js with Vite for a fast and modern development experience.
- **Backend:** A Node.js backend (e.g., using a framework like NestJS or Express.js) is recommended to maintain a consistent TypeScript/JavaScript-based technology stack across the project.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL serves as the primary relational database for storing all entity data, including users, pickups, rewards, and transactions.
- **AI/ML:**
    - **Route Optimization:** Hybrid DRL-GA algorithm.
    - **Waste Classification:** YOLOv5 for real-time object detection.
    - **Verification:** CNN-based architectures for Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
- **Cloud & DevOps:**
    - **Real-time Services:** Firebase for real-time data synchronization and push notifications.
    - **Deployment:** Containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes are planned for scalable deployment.

## 4. Security
Security is a top priority. The system implements multiple layers of protection:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Ensures users can only access features relevant to their role.
- **Data Protection:** Password hashing, email verification, and end-to-end data encryption.
- **Input Validation:** Rigorous validation to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
- **Secure Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for managing user sessions securely.
