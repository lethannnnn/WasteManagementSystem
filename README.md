  - Xcode (for iOS development, macOS only)

## âœ… Quick Start

**ðŸ“¦ Install all dependencies:**
```bash
npm run install:all
```

**ðŸš€ Start all applications for development:**
```bash
npm run start:all
```

**ðŸ“± For mobile testing on same device:**
```bash
npm run start:mobile    # Starts both Donor and Collector apps
```

**ðŸ’» For web applications:**
```bash
npm run start:web       # Starts both Admin and Sponsor portals
```

## Individual App Commands

### Mobile Apps (React Native with Expo)

**Donor Mobile App:**
```bash
npm run start:donor          # Start Expo dev server
npm run android:donor        # Run on Android
npm run ios:donor           # Run on iOS
npm run web:donor           # Run in browser
```

**Collector Mobile App:**

npm run start:collector      # Start Expo dev server
npm run android:collector    # Run on Android  
npm run ios:collector       # Run on iOS
npm run web:collector       # Run in browser
```

### Web Apps (React with Vite)

**Admin Dashboard:**
```bash
npm run start:admin         # Start development server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run build:admin         # Build for production
```

**Sponsor Portal:**
```bash
npm run start:sponsor       # Start development server (http://localhost:5174)
npm run build:sponsor       # Build for production
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Development Testing

### Concurrent Mobile Testing
Both mobile emulators can run simultaneously on the same device:
1. Start both mobile apps: `npm run start:mobile`
2. Use different ports for Metro bundlers
3. Test donor-collector interactions

### Port Configuration
- **Donor Mobile**: Expo dev server on default port
- **Collector Mobile**: Expo dev server on alternate port
- **Admin Web**: Vite dev server on port 5173
- **Sponsor Web**: Vite dev server on port 5174

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Themes

Each application has a distinct color theme:
- **Donor App**: Green theme (#2E7D32) - Environmental focus
